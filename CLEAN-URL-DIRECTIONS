Clean URL's procedure:

This is the stripped down version of wwhat I typically have to do for Apache.

apachectl -M | grep rewrite
if this command shows nothing, try this:

a2enmod rewrite
This will usually work, and enable the rewrite module in Apache, if not:

find /etc -name httpd*
or
find /etc -name apache2*
to find your Apache conf file.  And look for/enter this:

LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
AddModule mod_rewrite.c

The easiest way to enable the drupal .htaccess file is this:

<Directory /var/www/drupal>
AllowOverride All
</Directory>

and this, either in the above Directory block or on it's own:

AccessFileName .htaccess

Finally, in .htaccess, make sure the following RewriteBase is enabled:

RewriteBase /your-base-directory

This will make http://localhost/your-base-directory find index.php in /your-base-directory.

These are the easiest rules for enabling Clean URL's in Drupal I have found.
